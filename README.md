**What Do Computer Scientists Do and Why Is It Important?**
Computer scientists are responsible for developing new technologies and software, including apps, websites, and programs that are widely used daily. Their role involves ensuring that these creations are safe for users and comply with privacy and copyright laws. In addition to creating new technologies, computer scientists also focus on enhancing existing ones through research, aiming to increase their efficiency and capabilities.

**Approaching a Problem as a Computer Scientist:**
To approach a problem as a computer scientist, it is crucial to first understand the problem, its context, and the desired outcome. The following steps can help in solving a problem:

a. Identify the problem's goal or objective.
b. Understand the available resources and constraints.
c. Consider potential solutions or approaches that efficiently utilize the resources.
d. Implement and test the chosen solution to determine its effectiveness.
e. Reflect on the decision-making process and the impact of those decisions on the solution's outcome.

**Ethical Responsibilities of Computer Scientists:**
Ethical responsibility is a significant concern in computer science. Computer scientists should consider the broader societal implications of their work, not just the technical aspects. When working for an organization, computer scientists should prioritize the well-being and privacy of individuals and avoid any potential conflicts of interest.
